Prathamesh's Projects
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am Prathamesh, an aspiring AI/ML engineer and a student at Sarvajanik College of Engineering & Technology. I specialize in C, C++, Java, Python, and AI/ML. I'm passionate about Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and constantly solving problems to improve my skills.

Feel free to explore my projects, where youâ€™ll find various applications of my knowledge in the domains of machine learning, software development, and algorithmic problem-solving.

Skills
Programming Languages: C, C++, Java, Python
AI/ML: Machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, model building
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA): Solving problems related to arrays, trees, linked lists, dynamic programming, sorting, and more.
Projects
Diabetes Prediction Model: A machine learning project to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health metrics.
TreeUtils Library: A C++ library for tree-related functions, providing essential utilities for working with binary trees.
My Approach
I believe in hands-on learning and approach every project with a problem-solving mindset. By constantly challenging myself with DSA problems, I continue to build efficient and optimized solutions.
