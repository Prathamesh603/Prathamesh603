## Projects
### 1. [Surya Namaskar Pose Detection](https://github.com/Prathamesh603/SuryaNamaskar-Pose-Detection)

- **Description:** A real-time pose detection project that uses a trained model to recognize and analyze Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation) yoga poses. The system captures live camera input, estimates body angles, and provides feedback on posture accuracy. Ideal for fitness tracking and yoga practice improvement. ðŸš€
- **Technologies Used:**
 - Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe
- **Key Features:**
 - Real-time pose estimation using camera input
 - Body angle calculation for accurate pose analysis
 - Feedback mechanism to improve posture

### 2. [TreeUtils Library](https://github.com/Prathamesh603/TreeUtils)
   - **Description:** A C++ library providing essential utilities for working with binary trees.
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - **C++**
   - **Key Features:**
     - Binary tree creation and traversal
     - Various tree-related functions and utilities

### 3. [Diabetes Prediction Model](https://github.com/Prathamesh603/Diabetes-Prediction-Model)
   - **Description:** A machine learning project that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health metrics (like age, glucose level, BMI, etc.).
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **SVM Classifier**
   - **Key Features:**
     - Dataset: [Diabetes.csv](https://github.com/Prathamesh603/Diabetes-Prediction-Model/blob/main/diabetes.csv)
     - Model accuracy evaluation
     - Predictive system using a trained model



I believe in **hands-on learning** and approach every project with a problem-solving mindset. I constantly challenge myself by solving DSA problems and building efficient, optimized solutions.
